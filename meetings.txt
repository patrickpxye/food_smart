Meeting 10/14 2:00 PM

Progress
    1. Decided the baseline model architecture and implementation details
    2. Setup development environment
    3. Read through some relevant research work on food image detection

TODO:
    1. Validate the dataset source (Jordan)
    2. develop script to download dataset to local dev server (shoupei/Jordan)
    3. Setup training environment using pytorch
    4. Develop simple CNN using   (Patrick/Jordan/shoupei)
        4a) ResNet
        4b) pytorch library
    5. Evaluate pre-trained model (optional)
