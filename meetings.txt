Meetin 11/4
    1. We will experiment and compare these models:
        a. SVM (Shoupei)
        b. Adaboost for Decision Tree (Patrick)
        c. XGBboost for Decision Tree (Patrick)
        d. Doubled K-means (Jordan, Patrick)
        e. Baseline done: logistic regression (Shoupei)
    2. Prove these models don't work
        GDA Model: prove it's compute heavy
        Softmax Model: prove it's impossible for multi-labelling
    3. We make an argument about design choices (Patrick)
        - Reducing hypothesis space (ingredient classes): We are effectively lowering variance with a gain of computational efficiency, at the cost of increased bias.
        - Resnet as feature extractor: We are effectively lowering bias with effcient feature captures, at the cost of training time and higher variance.
